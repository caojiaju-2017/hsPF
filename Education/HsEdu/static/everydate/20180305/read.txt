About 43 million American renters spent a record $485.6 billion on rent checks in 2017, up by an incredible $4.9 billion from 2016, according to a new report from real estate database Zillow.
房地产数据库Zillow的一份最新报告显示，2017年美国约4300万租房者在租房上的花费达到破纪录的4856亿美元，较2016年增加了惊人的49亿美元。
On average, renter households spent nearly $11,300 last year, with the highest-paying renters living in New York City and Los Angeles.

About 1 million new renters join the market each year, and new renters are older and wealthier, according to a recent report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.

"San Francisco rents are so high that renters collectively paid $616 million more in rent than Chicago renters did, despite there being 467,000 fewer renters in San Francisco than in Chicago," Zillow wrote in the report.
Zillow在一则报告中写道：“旧金山的房租如此之高，以至于芝加哥的租房者租金比芝加哥租房者多6.16亿美元，尽管旧金山的租房者比芝加哥少46.7万。”
Changes in the recent tax bill will likely cause more young people to continue renting, since the legislation doesn't offer incentives toward homeownership, said Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas.
Zillow高级经济学家阿隆·特拉扎斯称，最近税收法案的改变很可能会导致更多的年轻人继续租房，因为该法案并没有提供住房的激励措施。
"As the housing market has recovered from the recession, home values are higher than they're ever been," Terrazas said. "That has pushed home prices out of reach for those looking to buy their first home."
特拉扎斯表示：“随着房地产市场从衰退中复苏，房价比以往任何时候都要高。这使得房价上涨到那些想买自己第一套房的人无法触及的水平。”
