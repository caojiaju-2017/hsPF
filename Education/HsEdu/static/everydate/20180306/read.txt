Alibaba's third-party online payment service platform, Alipay, released an emergency statement on its Weibo account, saying that everyone, including its staff, can pay how they want and their choice should be respected.
近日，阿里巴巴旗下第三方支付平台支付宝在其微博上做出紧急回应，表示每个人，包括自己的员工，可以以任何他们想要的方式支付，而且也应该被尊重。
The announcement came after Alibaba's Chairman Jack Ma was seen paying for his bill with a bank card instead of Alipay at a bar in southwest China's Chongqing, Jan. 10.
这一声明是在阿里巴巴董事长马云1月10日晚上在重庆的某个酒吧消费后并未选择支付宝支付，而是刷了银行卡之后发出的。
 
"Doesn't Alipay want to help build a cashless society?" Weibo users joked.
一位微博用户开玩笑说：“支付宝不是要打造一个无现金社会吗？”
However, Alipay said it has never wanted to put an end to cash, adding that new forms of payment don't make older ones obsolete.
然而，支付宝回应称，它从来没说过消灭现金，并表示新支付方式并不是要让旧的灭亡。
Jack Ma reportedly showed up at a little-known bar. However, he was soon recognized and left after about an hour.
据报道，马云日前现身重庆一家鲜为人知的酒吧。不过他还是很快被认出来了，并在约一小时后离开。
